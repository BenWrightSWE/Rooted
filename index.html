                        <p>Meditation comes in many forms but the most common one is called "Mindfulness
                        Meditation". As stated in the book "What the Buddha Taught", mindfulness meditation
                        happens through a series of steps:</p>
                        <br class="brBetweenSubSection">
                        <ol>
                            <li>One should sit cross legged, keeping the body erect (strait), but not stiff,
                                 and mindfulness alert. If unable to sit cross legged, one can sit on a chair 
                                 in a similar fashion.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Once seated, one may place their hands comfortably on their lap and choose 
                                between closing their eyes and gazing at the top of their nose.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Then, breath in and out as usual with no effort or strain. Bring one's mind to
                                concentrate on the breath. Let your mind observe the breath, but only to be aware
                                of them rather than to think about them (side not: from my experience, awareness
                                is the observation without thought, you can notice something without thinking of it;
                                that is what you're aiming for).
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Forget all things, your surrounding, your envrionment, and everything else outside of
                                your breath. Do not raise your eyes and look at anything. Attempt to do this for 5 to 10
                                minutes at a time.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <br class="brBetweenSubSection">
                        <p>Disclaimer: This is hard for a person to do. Do not expect to be able to focus on your breath the
                        whole time off the bat. It is normal for your mind to wander. Over time though you will gain the 
                        ability to do this task for increasing amounts of time. With this you will gain the benefits of 
                        meditation.</p>

                    <p id="footerParagraph2"> Summarized from what is stated in "What the Buddha Taught", the exercise of mindfulness meditation 
                        is meant to develop concentration. Apart from this, it is good for your physical health, for relaxation,
                        sound sleep, and efficiency in your daily work. It makes you calm and tranquil. Even at moments when you
                        are nervous or excited, if you practice this for a couple of minutes, you will see for yourself that you
                        will become immediately quiet and at peace.

                    <p id="footerParagraph3">There are numerous different guided meditation resources availible online, but the ones I've personally enjoyed
                        in the past are Medito and "Waking Up" by Sam Harris. Medito is an amazing meditation app that you can find on 
                        the IOS app store, which I highly recommend and have used A LOT in the past. "Waking Up" by Sam Harris is a
                        series on youtube or an app you can download. Although I only used it a few times in the past, the meditaion
                        sessions went well.
