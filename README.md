<u>Project Name:</u> Rooted

<u>Project Description:</u>

Rooted is a site with a meditaion timer. You can choose the time and press play/stop. Then each of the leaves can change the time.
As the time progresses the leaves change based on a prechosen set of sub times. When the timer is done there is an alert and sound. At the bottom the 
page it has a dropdown style article that allows the user to understand how and why they should meditate and also some good meditiation resources.

I used the technologies I did due to it being the first solution I could come up with. I do not know if these are the most efficient or even remotely 
utilized methods of doing what I did, but it is my first project including Javascript. 

- My main challenges included:
* When I stopped the timer and tried restarting it, it created a new timer and they would consistently switch being the timers set.
* When I was trying to change the color of the "leaves" of the tree, after the initial change, it wouldn't allow the hover change to occur.

- What features I hope to add
* after the timer ends, it displays a sound
* as the timer starts initially, but never after, when the user presses play a sound occurs
* make the formatting for iphone and potentially tablet.

<u>How to install and run the project:</u>

1. install the project files
2. go to the file
3. right click the index.html file
4. click open with (desired browser)
5. That is the project.

<u>How to use the project:</u>

1. Start up the web-page as described above (How to install and run the project).
2. Select a time from the 3 min, 5 min, and 10 min options. (if you dont and start timer away an alert will appear prompting the user to choose a time)
3. Press play. If throughout the timer you want to stop the timer press the same button (it has different symbol at this point).
4. If at any point through the timer you would like to choose a specific time within it, hover over the leaves and choose the desired time that is closest
   to the time you would like. (this will also change the color of the "leaves").
5. When the timer ends an alert will appear, click ok and the timer will reset with the play button changed.
6. If you scroll down the page, you will find 3 different headers with symbols beside them. If clicked, the header clicked's article will appear and the others
   will hide.

<u>How to contribute to the project:</u>

You wont be able to, this was supposed to be a project to help me learn javascript. Thank you for trying though.
